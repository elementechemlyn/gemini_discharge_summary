<h1>Discharge Summary for John Davis</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>John Davis is a 70-year-old man who lives with his wife in a two bedroom bungalo. He is a retired teacher. He has a past medical histor of COPD and hypertension.</p>
<p>He was referred to Central Teaching Hospital Acute Medical Unit by his GP and was subsequently admitted on the 10th of March 2023. He had a 4-day history of increasing breathlessness, productive grey sputum, and chest tightness. He had a low-grade temprature of 37.9 degrees Celsius on admission.</p>
<p>His Chest X-Ray showed hyperinflated lungs consistant with COPD but no focal consolidation. His CRP was raised at 65 but his WBC was normal. His SpO2 was 95% on room air.</p>
<p>He was treated for an infective exacebation of COPD and receieved nebulised Salbutamol and Ipratropium bromide for 24 hours, oral prednisolone and began a course of Doxycyline.</p>
<p>Following initial assessment on the AMU he was transfered to Ward A at Central Teaching Hospital under the care of Dr Emily Carter, Consultant Physician. His medcations on admission were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
<li>Seretide 250/50 dry powder inhaler 1 puff BD</li>
<li>Amlodipine 5mg OD</li>
</ul>
<p>He reported a previous allergy to Erythromycin, causing nausia more than 10 years ago. During his admission, the Seretide was stopped and replaced by Spiriva Respimat. His amlodipine was increased to 10mg OD as his BP was persitantly elevated.</p>
<p>He made a rapid improvement, did not require any nebulised treatment after day 1 of his admission and was therefore disharged home on the evening of 12th March 2023.</p>
<p>His medcation on discharge was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>

<li>Prednisolone 30mg OD for 4 days</li>
<li>Doxycycline 100mg OD for 7 days</li>
<li>Amlodipine 10mg OD</li>
</ul>
<p>No hospital follow up has been arranged but a referral was sent to the community COPD Specialist Nurse who will arrange to visit him in the next 5 days. His GP was asked to review his BP 10 days after discharge.</p>
