        <h1>Discharge Summary for John Doe</h1>

        <div class="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                John Doe is a 64-year-old man who lives with his wife in a bungalow. He is a retired builder. He has a past medical history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Essential Hypertension.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was refered to City General Hospital MAU by his GP and was subsequently admitted on the 20th of May 2024. He had a 4-day history of increasing breathlessnes, wheeze, and a productiv cough producing green sputum. He had a low-grade temperatrure of 38.1 degrees Celsius on admission.
            </p>
            <p>
                His CXR showed hyperinflated lungs consistent with COPD but no focal consolidation. His CRP was raised at 65 but his WBC was only slightly raised. His SpO2 was 94% on room air.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was treated for an infective exacerbation of COPD and recieved nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium bromide as needed, oral prednisolone and began a course of Amoxacillin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following initial assessment on the MAU he was transfered to Ward B at City General Hospital under the care of Dr E White, Consltant in Respiratory Medicine. His medications on admission were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Salbutamol 100 microgams 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
                <li>Beclomethasone 100 microgams 2 puffs BD</li>
                <li>Amlodipine 5mg OD</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                He reported a previous allergy to Aspirin, experienced more than 10 years ago, causing a widespread rash. During his admission, the Beclomethasone was stopped and replaced by a Budesonide/Formoterol combination inhaler. His amlodipine was increased to 10mg OD as his BP was persistanly elevated.
            </p>
            <p>
                He made a rapid improvement, did not require any nebulised treatment after the first day and was therefore discharged home on the evening of 22nd May 2024.
            </p>
            <p>His medication on discharge was:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
                <li>Budesonide 400mcg / Formoterol 12mcg dry powder inhaler, 1 puff BD</li>
                <li>Prednisolone 40mg OD for 5 days</li>
                <li>Amoxicillin 500mg TDS for 7 days</li>
                <li>Amlodipine 10mg OD</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                No hospital follow up has been arranged but a referral was sent to the Comunity COPD Spcialist Nurse who will arrange to visit him in the next 1-2 weeks. His GP was asked to review his BP a week after discharge.
