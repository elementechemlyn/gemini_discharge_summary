    <h1>Discharge Summary for Arthur Evans</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Arthur Evans is a 69-year-old man who lives with his wife in a bungalow. He is a retired builder. He has a past medical history of COPD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</p>
        <p>He was refered to City General Hospital MAU by his GP and was subsequently admitted on the 5th of October 2023. He had a 2-day history of worsening brethlessness, increased cough, and green sputum. He had a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius on admission.</p>
        <p>His CXR showed hyperinflated lungs with thickened bronchial walls but no focal consolidation. His CRP was raised at 72 but his WBC was normal. His SpO2 was 94% on room air.</p>
        <p>He was treated for an acute exacerbation of his COPD, likely infective, and recieved oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium bromide initially, oral prednisolone and began a course of amoxicillin.</p>
        <p>Following initial assessement on the MAU he was transferred to Ward F at City General Hospital under the care of Dr. J. Patel, Consultant in Respiratory Medicine. His medications on admission were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salbutamol MDI 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
            <li>Fostair 100/6 MDI 2 puffs BD</li>
            <li>Metformin 500mg three times daily</li>
            <li>Lisinopril 10mg OD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He reported a previous allergy to Aspirin, experienced more than 10 years ago, causing angioedema. During his admission, Lisinopril was stopped and he was started on Amlodipine 5mg OD as his BP was persistently elevated. His other home medications were continued.</p>
        <p>He made a rapid improvement, did not require any oxygen or nebulised treatment on day 2 of his admission and was therefore discharged home on the afternoon of 7th October 2023.</p>
        <p>His medication on discharge was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salbutamol MDI 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
            <li>Fostair 100/6 MDI 2 puffs BD</li>
            <li>Metformin 500mg three times daily</li>
            <li>Amlodipine 5mg OD</li>
            <li>Prednisolone 40mg OD for 5 days (course to complete)</li>
            <li>Amoxicillin 500mg three times daily (course to complete)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No hospital follow up has been arranged but a referral was sent to the commmunity Respiratory Team who will arrange to visit him in the next week. His GP was asked to review his BP and diabetes managment in two weeks.</p>
