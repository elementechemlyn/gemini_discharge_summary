        <h1>Discharge Summary for John Davies</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>John Davies is a 72-year-old man who lives with his wife in a two bedroom bungalow. He is a retired builder. He has a past medical history of COPD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</p>
        <p>He was refered to St. Luke's Hospital Medical Assessment Unit by his GP and was subsequently admitted on the 20th of October 2024. He had a 4-day history of worsening shortness of breath, increased cough productive of purulent green sputum, and felt feverish. He had a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius on admission.</p>
        <p>His CXR showed patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia. His WCC and CRP were elevated. His SpO2 was 90% on room air, requiring oxygen support during admission.</p>
        <p>He was treated for an acute exacerbation of COPD complicated by Community Acquired Pneumonia. He received nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium bromide, intravenous Co-amoxiclav, oral prednisolone, and subsequent oral doxycycline.</p>
        <p>Following initial assessment and treatment on the MAU, he was transferred to Ward B at St. Luke's Hospital under the care of Dr. S. Khan, Consultant Respiratory Physician. His medications on admission were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms MDI, 2 puffs PRN</li>
            <li>Beclometasone 200 micrograms MDI, 2 puffs BD</li>
            <li>Metformin 500mg, three times daily</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He reported a previous allergy to Sulphonamides (Co-trimoxazole), experienced more than 10 years ago, causing a widespread rash. During his admission, the Beclometasone was stopped and replaced by Fostair (Budesonide/Formoterol). His Metformin dose was increased to 850mg three times daily due to elevated blood glucose readings.</p>
        <p>He made good improvement, oxygen was weaned and discontinued on day 3 of admission. He was well enough to be discharged home on the evening of 23rd October 2024.</p>
        <p>His medication on discharge was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms MDI, 2 puffs PRN</li>
            <li>Fostair 100/6 dry powder inhaler, 2 puffs BD</li>
            <li>Prednisolone 40mg OD for 3 more days</li>
            <li>Doxycycline 100mg OD for 5 more days</li>
            <li>Metformin 850mg, three times daily</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No hospital follow up has been arranged but a referral was sent to the community COPD Matron who will arrange to visit him in the next week. His GP was asked to review his respiratory status and diabetes control a week after discharege.</p>
