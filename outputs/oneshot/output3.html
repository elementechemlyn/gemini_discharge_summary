<h1>Discharge Summary for Mr Alan Davis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Alan Davis is a 72-year-old man who resides with his spouse in a two-bedroom bungalow. He is a retired plumber. He has a past medical history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Type 2 Diabetus Mellitus.</p>
<p>He was referred to City Hospital Assessment Unit by his GP and admitted on the 21st of October 2023. He presented with a 4-day history of worsening shortness of breath, increased cough, and change in sputum color to green. He reported a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>His initial chest X-ray showed changes consistent with COPD but no evidence of pneumonia. Inflammatory markers were elevated, with a CRP of 65 and a normal White Blood Cell count. Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.</p>
<p>He was treated for an acute exacerbation of COPD, receiving nebulised bronchodilators (salbutamol and ipratropium), a course of oral prednisolone, and commenced on amoxicillin.</p>
<p>Following assessment, he was transferred to Ward C, under the care of Dr. Eleanor Vance, Consultant Respiratory Physician. His regular medications on admission included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
    <li>Tiotropium 18 micrograms, inhaled Once Daily</li>
    <li>Metformin 500mg Twice Daily</li>
</ul>
<p>He reported no known allergies. During his admission, Tiotropium was stopped and replaced with a combined inhaler containing Budesonide and Formoterol. His blood sugar levels remained stable, and Metformin was continued unchanged. His amoxicillin was switched to co-amoxiclav based on local antibioteic guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis showed steady improvement, requiring nebulisers for the first 36 hours but then managing well on his new inhaler. He was discharged home on the evening of 23rd October 2023.</p>
<p>His medication on discharge was:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Salbutamol 100 micrograms 2 puffs, inhaled PRN</li>
    <li>Budesonide/Formoterol 200/6 dry powder inhaler One puff Twice Daily</li>
    <li>Prednisolone 30mg OD for 5 days</li>
    <li>Co-amoxiclav 250/125mg Three times a day for 7 days</li>
    <li>Metformin 500mg Twice Daily</li>
</ul>
<p>No hospital follow-up is planned. A referral has been sent to the community COPD Nurse who will arrange a home visit in the coming week to assess his inhaler technique and provide self-management advice. His GP was informed and asked to review him in 2 weeks.</p>
