    <h1>Discharge Summary for Arthur Pendelton</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Mr. Arthur Pendelton is a 72-year-old man who lives with his wife in a ground floor flat. He is a retired factory worker. He has a past medical history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonery Disease (COPD) and Atrial Fibrillation.</p>
        <p>He was referred to City General Hospital Assessment Unit by his GP and was admitted on the 20th of October 2023. He presented with a 4-day history of worsening shortness of breath, cough productive of green sputum, and feeling generally unwell. He reported no fever.</p>
        <p>His chest X-ray showed evidence of emphysematous changes consistent with COPD but no new consolidation. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 65, but his white blood cell count was normal. Oxygen saturations were 94% on room air upon admission.</p>
        <p>He was treated for an acute exacerbation of COPD. Treatment included nebulised Salbutamol, oral Prednisolone, and a course of Amoxicillin.</p>
        <p>Following initial assessment, he was transferred to Willow Ward under the care of Dr. E. Adams, Consultant Respiratory Physician. His regular medications on admission were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salbutamol 100mcg MDI, 2 puffs when needed (PRN)</li>
            <li>Tiotropium 18mcg inhaler, 1 capsule daily</li>
            <li>Bisoprolol 5mg, once daily</li>
            <li>Warfarin, dose adjusted according to INR</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He reported no known allergies. During his admission, Warfarin was temporarilly stopped due to concerns about interaction with Amoxicillin and switched to Rivaroxaban 15mg BD for the duration of the antibiotic course. Bisoprolol was reduced to 2.5mg OD due to a brief episode of bradycardia.</p>
        <p>He showed gradual improvement over his stay. Nebulisers were discontinud on day 3. He was deemed well enough for discharge home on the afternoon of 24th October 2023.</p>
        <p>His medication on discharge was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salbutamol 100mcg MDI, 2 puffs PRN</li>
            <li>Tiotropium 18mcg inhaler, 1 capsule OD</li>
            <li>Bisoprolol 2.5mg, once daily</li>
            <li>Rivaroxaban 15mg, twice daily for a further 3 days</li>
            <li>Amoxicillin 500mg, three times daily for a further 4 days</li>
            <li>Prednisolone 30mg, once daily for 2 more days, then stop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No hospital follow up is required. A referral was made to the community COPD team for a home visit within a week. The GP was asked to arrange a review for consideration of restarting Warfarin and monitoring his Bisoprolol dose after the antibiotic course is completed.</p>

        <h2>Clinical summary</h2>
        <p>Mr. Pendelton was admitted with a 4-day history of worsening respiratory symptoms. On examination, he had increased work of breathing and widespread wheeze. Initial investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 65, normal WCC) and CXR changes consistent with underlying COPD but no pneumonia. He was treated for an acute infective exacerbation of COPD with nebulised Salbutamol, systemic Prednisolone (30mg OD), and Amoxicillin (500mg TDS). His regular Warfarin was temporarily discontinued and changed to Rivaroxaban due to potential drug interactions and for simiplicity during the acute phase. His Bisoprolol dose was halved due to transient bradycardia. He responded well to treatment, his breathlessness improved, cough settled, and oxygen requirements remained low. Nebulisers were stopped after 72 hours. He was stable and mobile prior to discharge.</p>
