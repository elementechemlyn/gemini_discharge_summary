        <h2>Summary of Hospital Stay</h2>
        <p>On arrival, Mrs. Vance was febrile (38.5Â°C), tachycardic (105 bpm), and tachypnoeic (24 bpm) with saturations of 92% on air, improving to 95% on 2L nasal cannulae. Clinical examination revealed crackles in the right lower lung zone.</p>
        <p>Investigations included chest X-ray which showed consolidation in the right lower lobe. Blood tests demonstrated a raised CRP and white cell count consistent with infection. Sputum sample was sent for microscopy and culture.</p>
        <p>A diagnosis of Community Acquired Pneumonia was made. Intravenous Amoxicillin 500mg was commenced three times daily. Supportive measures included oxygen therapy, IV fluids for hydration, and regular paracetamol for temperature and discomfort. Mrs. Vance responded well to treatment, with improvment in her temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen requirements, and cough over 72 hours. She transitioned to oral antibiotics and was tolerating fluids and food orally prior to discharge.</p>
