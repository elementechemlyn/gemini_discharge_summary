        <h2>Reason for Admission</h2>
        <p>66-year-old female admited with a 3-day history of worsening chest pain on exertion, associated with breathlessness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>History of Presenting Compliant</h2>
        <p>Mrs Vance reported chest pain which had become more frequent and severe over the last few days. The pain was described as a pressure sensation in the centre of the chest, radiating slightly to the left arm. It was typically triggered by walking up a gentle slope or carrying shopping, reliving with rest. This was different from her usual stable angina pattern. She also noted increased fatigue and shortness of breath with less exertion than previously. No clear anginal equivalents like jaw pain or significant sweating. Denied fever, cough, or leg swelling.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hospital Course & Treatment</h2>
        <p>Mrs Vance was admitted to rule out Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) given the change in her angina patern. Serial troponins were reassuringly negative. She was managed medically with bed rest initially, continuous monitoring, and pain relief as needed (which was minimal after the first day). Her medication was reviewed and optimised. Intravenous nitrates were not required. She was started on clopidogrel in addition to her existing aspirin for secondary prevention, pending cardiology review and potential angiography.</p>
        <p>She remained stable throughout the admission, with no further episodes of chest pain. Mobilised gradually on the ward without issues.</p>
