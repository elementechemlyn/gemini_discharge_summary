        <h2>Summary of Hospital Stay</h2>
        <p>Patient Sarah Thompson was admitted with a suspected infective exacerbation of COPD. On arrival, she was hypoxemic and required supplemental oxygen. Initial treatment included nebulised bronchodilators (Salbutamol and Ipratropium) and a course of oral prednisolone.</p>
        <p>Despite initial treatment, oxygen requirments increased and she developed new crackles on auscultation. A chest X-ray on day 2 showed new consolidation in the right lower lobe. Bloods showed elevated inflammatory markers. Diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia was made.</p>
        <p>Treatment was escalated to intravenous Co-amoxiclav, with subsequent switch to oral Co-amoxiclav as per microbiology advice and clinical improvement. She also receved a short course of oral Clarithromycin initially.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the admission, her respiratory symptoms gradually improved. Oxygen was weaned off successfully by day 6. Physiotherapy input assisted with sputum clearance and mobility. Her diabetes was monitored, and her existing oral medication regimen was sufficient to maintian blood glucose control during the stay. Blood pressure remained stable on existing medication.</p>
        <p>She became afebrile on day 4 and remained stable thereafter. She was mobilising independently around the ward prior to discharge.</p>
